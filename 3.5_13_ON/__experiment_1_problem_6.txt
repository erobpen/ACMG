% MiniZinc model to find the number of bags stolen for each type of coins

% Parameters (number of bags stolen for each type of coins)
int: x1; % bags of 16c
int: x2; % bags of 17c
int: x3; % bags of 23c
int: x4; % bags of 24c
int: x5; % bags of 39c
int: x6; % bags of 40c

% Constraint: Total value of coins = 100
constraint 16*x1 + 17*x2 + 23*x3 + 24*x4 + 39*x5 + 40*x6 = 100;

% Additional constraint: The number of bags must be a whole number
constraint x1 >= 0 /\ x2 >= 0 /\ x3 >= 0 /\ x4 >= 0 /\ x5 >= 0 /\ x6 >= 0;

% Solve the system of equations
solve satisfy;

% Output the number of bags stolen for each type of coins
