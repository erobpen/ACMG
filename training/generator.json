There can be 1.3 subracks. Each subrack comes with predefined boards. We can categorize boards into three types based on their predefined nature. First, boards that come only in those fixed slots; second, boards that come in fixed slots but also have dynamic allocation; and third, boards that go only into dynamic slots. We call those categories CAT1, CAT2, CAT3, CAT3, respectively. Each subrack has fixed first slots (0..m), which are predefined, and last slots (n-m..n). Slots from m.n.m. are dynamic. We refer to a board as BOARD if it occupies a single slot. If it occupies two slots, we refer to it as an LBOARD. There are 3 types of connectors: CON1, CON2, and CON3. We use different connectors for different types of cables. Cables with two ends use CON1, cables with three ends use CON2, and cables with four ends use CON4. This implies that the quantities for CON1, CON2, and CON3 should be 2, 3, and 4, respectively. DIR, 3P, and X stand for Direct, 3-Point, and Cross cables, respectively. Only one type of sigle slot board, known as GPT, receives all of those connectors. Each subrack receives at least two GPTs in the second and penultimate positions. If only one, two, or three subracks are available, the GPT board connects to the motherboard (MB) using DIR, 3P, and X cables. The MB always connects to the first GPT board. The DIR cable connects the two GPT boards in each subrack. \\n\\nSemantic entities extracted: \n% Parameters\nn_slots;         % Slots per subrack\nn_subracks;      % Number of subracks\nn_board_types;   % Total number of board types\n% Board types enumeration (in order matching the requirements matrix)\nBOARD = {EMPTY, BOARD1, BOARD2, BOARD3, LBOARD1, LBOARD2};\n% Variables\nplacement[1..n_subracks, 1..n_slots]: Board placements in each subrack and slot\ninitial_board_counts[BOARD]; % Total count of each board type used\nboard_counts[BOARD]; % Count of each board type used\nfixed_slots; % Predefined fixed slots\ndynamic_slots; % Predefined dynamic slots\nCAT1; % Set of boards in category 1\nCAT2; % Set of boards in category 2\nCAT3; % Set of boards in category 3\nCONNECTOR = {DIR, P3, X};\nconnector_counts[CONNECTOR];\n% Constraints\nSpace constraints for LBOARDs\nSlot constraints for CAT1 boards\nSlot constraints for CAT2 boards\nBoard1 on slots 2 and 27 constraint\nConnector counts constraints"

Tiles are hexagrams. Each tile has up to 6 neighbors. Unless it is border tile. There are the following types of tiles: land and sea. We divide LAND into Coast (CO), Mountain (MO), Forest (FO), Hill (HI), and Grassland (GR). Border tiles are CO and MO. For each type mentioned, there are three different types. You can rotate it six times before it reaches the start position. SEA ends with CO before transitioning to another type of tile. MO, but transition to HI. HI can transition to CO, MO, FO, and GR. Each type can border with itself. You can place the River (R) on top of FO, HI, and GR, but it must start at MO and end on the CO tile. You can place the Path (P) on top of the FO, HI, and GR tiles. Both R and P represent lines in a two-dimensional plane; if they intersect, we place Bridge B; if they don't, we align P and R in parallel, and we designate this tile with PR. A crossroads X tile is formed when two paths intersect. If two rivers cross, one ends there; this is the Y tile.Â \\n\\nSemantic entities extracted: \n- Parameters:\n  - n: Number of rows (tiles in the vertical dimension)\n  - m: Number of columns (tiles in the horizontal dimension)\n  - total_tiles: Total number of tiles (n * m)\n  - TileTypes: Set of integers representing different tile types\n  - SEA, CO, MO, FO, HI, GR: Integer constants representing different tile types\n  - RIVER, PATH: Integer constants representing overlays on tiles\n  - per: Array representing the percentage distribution of different LAND types\n- Variables:\n  - board: 2D array of variable TileTypes representing the map\n  - river1_start_row, river1_start_col, river1_end_row, river1_end_col: Variables indicating river 1 start and end coordinates\n  - river2_start_row, river2_start_col, river2_end_row, river2_end_col: Variables indicating river 2 start and end coordinates\n  - is_river_1, is_river_2: 2D arrays of boolean variables indicating the presence of rivers\n  - is_path: 2D array of boolean variables indicating the presence of paths\n  - is_bridge: 2D array of boolean variables indicating bridge presence\n  - is_parallel: 2D array of boolean variables indicating parallel river and path\n  - is_crossroads: 2D array of boolean variables indicating crossroads\n  - is_y_intersection: 2D array of boolean variables indicating Y-shaped intersection\n- Constraints:\n  - Tile count constraints for different tile types\n  - Border rules for map\n  - Neighboring rules for hexagonal adjacency\n  - Transition rules for specific tiles\n  - River start and end constraints\n  - Path and river constraints\n  - Bridge, parallel, crossroads, and Y-intersection constraints"
