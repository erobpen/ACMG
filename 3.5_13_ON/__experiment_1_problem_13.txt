___________
% Given the problem description, we need to find four different numbers a, b, c, and d in the range of 1 to 100, such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2.

% Define decision variables
var 1..100: a; % a in the range [1, 100]
var 1..100: b; % b in the range [1, 100]
var 1..100: c; % c in the range [1, 100]
var 1..100: d; % d in the range [1, 100]

% Constraint: The numbers a, b, c, and d must be different from each other
constraint all_different([a, b, c, d]);

% Constraint: The equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2 must be satisfied
constraint a*a + b*b = c*c + d*d;

% Find a solution that satisfies all constraints
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output ["a: ", show(a), "\n"];
output ["b: ", show(b), "\n"];
output ["c: ", show(c), "\n"];
output ["d: ", show(d), "\n"];

% No additional information needs to be provided in the data.dzn file as all the variables are decision variables in the model and are assigned values in the model itself. Thus, the data.dzn file will be empty.
