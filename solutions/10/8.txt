% Decision Variables
var 0..required_panels: panels_purchased; % The number of solar panels purchased

% Constraints
constraint panels_purchased * cost_per_panel <= budget; % Cost constraint
constraint budget - panels_purchased * cost_per_panel >= 0; % Remaining budget for purchased electricity
constraint panels_purchased * electricity_per_panel + (demand - panels_purchased * electricity_per_panel) >= demand; % Ensuring demand is met

% Objective
solve satisfy;

% Output
