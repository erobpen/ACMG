LAND is further divided into Coast (CO), Mountain (MO), Forest (FO), Hill (HI), and Grassland (GR), with border tiles restricted to CO and MO. Each type of LAND tile has three variations, and all tiles can be rotated six times before returning to their original orientation. SEA tiles always transition to CO tiles, while MO transitions to HI. HI tiles can transition to CO, MO, FO, or GR, and each type can border with itself. Rivers (R) and paths (P) can be placed on top of FO, HI, MO, CO and GR tiles. Each river must start from a Mountain (MO) tile and end on a Coast (CO) tile, while paths can traverse FO, HI, and GR tiles freely. When a river and path intersect, a Bridge (B) tile is placed, and if they run parallel on the same tile, it becomes a PR tile. A crossroads tile, X, is formed when two paths intersect, and if two rivers cross, one river ends at the intersection, creating a Y tile. There are two rivers and two paths on this map, each weaving through the terrain and interacting with the various LAND tiles. Generate the map while adhering to these conditions, ensuring the correct transitions between SEA, CO, and other LAND types, and placing rivers, paths, bridges, and special tiles like X and Y based on their intersections and flow.\n\nBoard Allocation 1 - boards and large boards\nhome electricity management 2\nprompt token budget 2\nScheduler - school - mid\nhome electricity management\n\nGenerate the output based on the given task.
