    The n-Queens Problem is a classic puzzle where the objective is to place n queens on a standard nxn chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. In chess, a queen can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Therefore, the challenge is to arrange the queens so that no two share the same row, column, or diagonal.
n queens on the board without them threatening each other.
A valid solution is one where all queens are positioned according to these rules, with numerous possible configurations.

    Some boards have more than two slots; we call them large boards, or LBOARD. Large boards can accommodate a single smaller board, known as a SBOARD. Each LBOARD and SBOARD are available in distinct quantities. Each SBOARD has a distinct allocation pattern for the first two LBOARDs. There are two possible patterns: the first pattern is to allocate the upper and lower slots of the first LBOARD and then the upper and lower slots of the second LBOARD with SBOARDs; the second pattern is to allocate the upper slots of the first and second LBOARDs first and then the lower slots of LBOARDs with SBOARDs going from left to right.

2. Routes
3. Time Slots
4. Intersections

Domains:
Each vehicle  must be assigned a route and a time slot.
Routes are predefined paths between intersections.
Time slots represent discrete time intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

Constraints:

1. Capacity Constraints:
  Each route has a maximum capacity of vehicles that can travel on it during any given time slot.

2. Travel Time Constraints:
  Each route has an associated travel time.
  The arrival time for any vehicle on some route must be within the acceptable range for its destination.

3. Intersection Constraints:
  Each intersection can handle a limited number of vehicles at any time slot to avoid congestion.

4. Scheduling Constraints:
  Vehicles must depart at their assigned time slots.
  No two vehicles can occupy the same position on a route at the same time.

5. Priority Constraints:
  Emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) must be given priority on routes and intersections.

6. Continuity Constraints:
  Once a vehicle starts on a route, it must continue without interruption until it reaches its destination.

    The Internet Network Traffic Routing and Scheduling problem involves satisfying data transmission requirements for users, while coordinating the flow of data packets through a network of routers and links.
Each link (network connection) has a certain capacity, latency, and possibly other attributes such as costs or bandwidth limits.
There are 'n' data packets, each with a specified source and destination.
Each data packet must be assigned a route from its source to its destination and requires some amount of bandwidth that is dependent on
the packet size.
The route for each data packet should be chosen to minimize latency, bandwidth consumption, or other specified costs.
Data packets may have specific transmission and delivery time windows.
The schedule must ensure that data packets do not exceed the link capacities at any given time to avoid congestion.
Network capacity constraints: The amount of data on any network link must not exceed its capacity.
Time constraints: Data packets must be transmitted and delivered within their specified time windows.
Each link has a capacity (maximum data it can handle), latency (time it takes for data to travel), and cost (resource usage or monetary cost) and bandwidth
limit (the maximum bandwidth it can provide).
Each packet has a size, source, destination, and possibly priority levels.
Scheduling must prevent any link from becoming overloaded to ensure smooth data flow.
Ensure that critical data packets meet their required maximum latency and bandwidth needs.
A valid solution to the Internet Network Traffic Routing and Scheduling problem ensures that all data packets are delivered to their destinations on time, complying with all constraints and optimizing for specified objectives.

    The Individual Car Production Planning problem involves satisfying production requirements for different car models, while coordinating the selection and assembly of mechanical parts.


There are m different car models, each with specific requirements for mechanical parts.
Each car model has a bill of materials (BOM) that lists all the required mechanical parts and their quantities.
Mechanical parts have various attributes including cost, weight, compatibility, and availability.

The goal is to plan the production of each car model to meet demand while minimizing costs, production time, or other specified metrics.
Ensure that each car model meets quality and performance standards.

Mechanical parts must be selected from a pool of available parts, considering cost, compatibility, and availability.
Parts must be allocated to each car model according to its BOM.

Production facilities have limited capacity in terms of the number of cars that can be produced and the number of parts that can be handled simultaneously.
Production schedules must ensure that each car model is produced within its specified time frame.
Parts inventory must be managed to avoid shortages or overstock.

All selected parts must comply with quality and safety regulations.
Each car model must pass all required safety and performance tests.

Satisfy the total cost of production, which includes the cost of parts, labor, and other production resources.
Consider bulk purchasing discounts and supplier contracts.

Adapt the production plan in response to changes in demand, parts availability, or production capacity.

A valid solution to the Individual Car Model Production Planning problem ensures that all car models are produced on time, within budget, and meet all quality and performance standards, while satisfying the use of available resources and complying with all constraints.

Cities do not have to be connected, and when they are not, there is a zero in the matrix for their distance.
There is also a nxn matrix that describes the terrain obstacles between them that range from 1 to 5.

    Problem Description: Airline Crew Rostering in Regional Airlines
Variables:
Crew members (pilots, co-pilots, flight attendants)
(for pilots there are experience level (integer (1, 2 or 3))arrays, and qualification levels)
(home base and salary arrays for all crew members(index))
Flights (routes, departure times, arrival times)
Time period: 14 days
Airports (home base and overnight locations) (assume every base in the problem has an airport)
The map is modeled with a 2d array of ariports intersections where diagonal zeros, and the airports that are not connected also,
and the rest have distances between two airports.
Aircraft types
(all types have their pilot qualification requirement (in a special array), and all types have their maximum distance
that it can be travelled with that type, there has to be a constraint that checks if a flights distance is
larger than the plane types allowed distance)
Constraints:


Qualifications:

Pilots must be qualified for specific aircraft types


Minimum experience levels for certain routes or aircraft
(if a route is longer than some distance, that requires a larger pilot experience level)


Crew pairing:
Each flight must have the required number of crew members (e.g., 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants)


Fairness:
Balanced allocation of weekend work and holidays
(no crew member can work more than 5 days in a row)


Legal requirements:
Compliance with local labor laws and union agreements
(no worker must work more than 20 hours a day)


Aircraft-specific constraints:
Certain routes may require specific aircraft types

Goals:
Primary goal: Create a feasible schedule that satisfies all constraints
aims to minimize the changes in qualification levels between consecutive flights
for a crew member. This is to reduce the complexity and potentially the cost
associated with training and transitioning between different types of aircraft.
Minimize total crew costs (salaries, hotel stays (hotel stays are all days that crew members spend away
from their home base, suppose each hotel day costs 100 dollars))
Maximize crew utilization (minimize idle time)
Minimize the number of crew position changes (to reduce training costs and improve familiarity)

The 8 Queens Problem is a classic puzzle where the objective is to place eight queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. In chess, a queen can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Therefore, the challenge is to arrange the queens so that no two share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The problem can be expanded to any 𝑛×𝑛 chessboard, known as the n-queens problem, where the task is to place
n queens on the board without them threatening each other. The 8 Queens Problem specifically deals with n=8.
A valid solution is one where all queens are positioned according to these rules, with numerous possible configurations.

Additionally, two double-slot boards, LBOARD1 and LBOARD2, are available, with two of each. SBOARD1 and SBOARD2, the smaller boards, come in quantities of 3 and 4, respectively. Importantly, only LBOARD1 can accommodate SBOARD1, while both LBOARD1 and LBOARD2 can accommodate SBOARD2.

In terms of slot allocation, BOARD1 and BOARD2 can only occupy odd-numbered slots, while BOARD3 can fit into slots 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. LBOARDs are restricted to even slots. Specifically, LBOARD2 can only occupy slots that are powers of 2, such as 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, and 2^4.

We increase the steps for LBOARD1 by 1, starting with the upper slot followed by the lower slot, forming a mirror N allocation. This type of allocation resembles the inverse of the letter N, whereas Z allocation forms a Z shape, with the first two slots allocated before the lower two slots. The available slots for boards total 50, and among these, only two types of LBOARDs are available. LBOARD1 is allocated in odd quantities, while LBOARD2 is available in even quantities, specifically 13 and 14, respectively. LBOARD1 follows a sequence of 0, 2, 3,..., 13, and LBOARD2 in steps of 0, 2, 4, and 6. Despite these allocation steps, the pattern of allocation depends on the SBOARDs rather than the LBOARDs.

SBOARD1 is restricted to LBOARD1, whereas SBOARD2 can be placed in both LBOARD1 and LBOARD2. There are 26 members of SBOARD1 and 28 members of SBOARD2. The type of allocation for the boards, whether mirror N or Z, can be chosen independently of the LBOARDs, and you may start by allocating the first two SBOARDs as either inverse N or Z. Additionally, you are free to allocate the remaining boards in either pattern, regardless of the initial allocation. In Z allocation, LBOARD1 is filled first, followed by the mirror N allocation, while LBOARD2 is handled in reverse.

Each subrack can have between 0 to n slots, with a configuration of 1.3 subracks. Each subrack consists of predefined boards, categorized into three types based on their predefined nature. These boards can be classified into three categories: CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3. Boards in CAT1 are restricted to fixed slots, while CAT2 boards are assigned to both fixed slots and those with dynamic allocation. CAT3 boards are placed only in dynamic slots. For example, there are three subracks with 28 slots each, where the first five and last five slots are fixed, while the middle slots from m to n are dynamic. The fixed first slots (0..m) and the last ones (n-m..n) play an essential role in this categorization.

Among the boards, some occupy a single slot, called BOARD, while others take up two slots, referred to as LBOARD. LBOARD1 and BOARD3 are examples of CAT1, with LBOARD1 taking up slots 1 and 27 and BOARD3 assigned to slots 3 and 26. BOARD2, which belongs to CAT2, is allowed to use both fixed and dynamic slots, such as slots 4 through 8 and 21 through 25. In contrast, boards classified under CAT3, like BOARD1 and LBOARD2, occupy only dynamic slots, with BOARD1 fitting into even-numbered slots and LBOARD2 occupying odd-numbered slots.

For instance, BOARD1 requires LBOARD2, BOARD2 requires LBOARD1, and LBOARD2 requires BOARD2. BOARD1 comes in a quantity of 2. We must provide BOARD2 to BOARD1, indicating that BOARD1 requires BOARD2, although providing BOARD2 does not imply that BOARD1 is automatically included. This first relation is considered mandatory, while others are optional, unless otherwise specified. Requirements between boards can range from 1-to-1 to 1-to-m, using the symbols REQ1 through REQm.

Each subrack can have 0 to n slots, with 1 to 3 subracks available, each consisting of 28 slots. These subracks come with predefined boards, categorized into three types based on their slot allocation. CAT1 boards occupy only fixed slots, CAT2 boards can occupy both fixed and dynamic slots, and CAT3 boards are placed only in dynamic slots. The first 5 and last 5 slots in each subrack are fixed, while the remaining slots (6 to 23) are dynamic. A board that occupies a single slot is called a BOARD, while one that occupies two slots is referred to as an LBOARD. There are two LBOARDs—LBOARD1 and LBOARD2—and three types of BOARDS: BOARD1, BOARD2, and BOARD3. The connectors used vary by the type of cable: CON1 is for two-ended cables, CON2 for three-ended, and CON3 for four-ended cables, with required quantities of 2, 3, and 4 connectors respectively.

In this configuration, BOARD1 and BOARD3 fall under CAT1, with BOARD1 placed in slots 2 and 27 and LBOARD1 occupying slots 3 and 25. BOARD2 belongs to CAT2 and can be placed in slots 4 through 8 and 21 through 25. Meanwhile, BOARD1 and LBOARD2, which belong to CAT3, are positioned in even and odd slots, respectively. Notably, BOARD1 serves as the GPT board, which receives all connector types: DIR (Direct), 3P (3-Point), and X (Cross) cables. Each subrack contains at least two GPT boards in the second and penultimate positions, connecting to the motherboard (MB) using the DIR cable for direct connections, 3P for three-point connections, and X for cross connections. The MB is always linked to the first GPT board in each subrack, while DIR cables connect the two GPT boards within each subrack.

Determine the position, quantity, and type of connectors for each board and ensure the proper connection of GPT boards to the motherboard based on the number of available subracks.

The map editor features a rectangular grid measuring n x m, with a specific size of 30 x 40 tiles. Each tile is a hexagram, allowing up to six neighboring connections unless it is a border tile, where the number of neighbors may be fewer. The map consists of two main types of tiles: LAND and SEA, with 10% of the map designated as SEA and the remaining 90% as LAND. LAND is further divided into Coast (CO), Mountain (MO), Forest (FO), Hill (HI), and Grassland (GR). Of the LAND tiles, 10% are Mountain (MO). Each LAND tile type has three distinct variations, and all tiles can be rotated six times to return to their original orientation. MO tiles typically transition to Hills (HI), and HI tiles can transition to CO, MO, FO, or GR tiles, with each type capable of bordering itself. SEA tiles are surrounded by CO tiles before transitioning to other LAND types, creating a natural coastal boundary. Border tiles on the map are restricted to CO and MO, marking the edges of the terrain. The layout dynamically generates transitions between LAND and SEA, carefully maintaining the designated proportions.

The map editor is a rectangular grid of n x m, with the specific size being 30 x 40 tiles. Each tile is a hexagram, allowing up to six neighboring connections, unless it is a border tile. The map consists of two main types of tiles: LAND and SEA, where 15% of the map is SEA and the remaining 85% is LAND. LAND is divided into Coast (CO), Mountain (MO), Forest (FO), Hill (HI), and Grassland (GR), with 10% of LAND designated as MO tiles. Border tiles are either CO or MO. Each type of LAND tile, including CO, MO, FO, HI, and GR, has three variations, and tiles can be rotated six times before returning to their original orientation. SEA tiles transition into CO tiles, while MO tiles often transition into HI. HI tiles can border CO, MO, FO, or GR, and all tile types can border with themselves. SEA tiles are bordered by CO tiles to create a natural coastal boundary. Additionally, the map allows the placement of a river (R) and a path (P), which can both overlay FO, HI, and GR tiles. The river must start from a Mountain (MO) tile and end on a Coast (CO) tile. If the river and path intersect, the tile is designated as a Bridge (B). If they run parallel on the same tile, it is labeled PR. The river and path represent linear elements that weave across the two-dimensional plane of the map, adding complexity to the terrain. Generate the map based on these parameters, ensuring accurate transitions between SEA, CO, and LAND types, while incorporating one river and one path, with appropriate connections, intersections, or parallels.

Rivers (R) and paths (P) can be placed on top of FO, HI, MO, CO and GR tiles. Each river must start from a Mountain (MO) tile and end on a Coast (CO) tile, while paths can traverse FO, HI, and GR tiles freely. When a river and path intersect, a Bridge (B) tile is placed, and if they run parallel on the same tile, it becomes a PR tile. A crossroads tile, X, is formed when two paths intersect, and if two rivers cross, one river ends at the intersection, creating a Y tile. There are two rivers and two paths on this map, each weaving through the terrain and interacting with the various LAND tiles. Generate the map while adhering to these conditions, ensuring the correct transitions between SEA, CO, and other LAND types, and placing rivers, paths, bridges, and special tiles like X and Y based on their intersections and flow.

We need to install a radio antenna at an inaccessible site that has strict limitations on power consumption, weight capacity, and floor layout. At the same time, we aim to maximize the variety in capacity and speed while keeping the installation cost-effective. The site can accommodate a maximum weight of 100 kg, a power consumption limit of 60W, and has a floor plan area of 12 square meters available for the installation. There are three types of antennas to choose from: parabolic (PAR), monopole (MON), and dipole (DIP), each with different characteristics in terms of weight, power consumption, floor space, and performance:
PAR weighs 2 kg, consumes 3 kWh, takes up 1 square meter of space, costs 30k$, provides 8 channels, with a download data rate of 2 Mbit/s and upload rate of 1 Mbit/s. The idle ping is 7 ms, while the ping during download is 14 ms, and during upload is 21 ms.
MON weighs 3 kg, consumes 9 kWh, requires 2 square meters of space, costs 40k$, offers 256 channels, has a download rate of 4 Mbit/s and upload rate of 2 Mbit/s. The idle ping is 10 ms, while the ping increases to 45 ms during download and 125 ms during upload.
DIP weighs 4 kg, consumes 27 kWh, takes up 1 square meter of floor space, costs 50k$, delivers 64 channels, with a download rate of 16 Mbit/s and upload rate of 3 Mbit/s. The idle ping is 10 ms, rising to 82 ms during download and 324 ms during upload.
The goal is to achieve a total download rate of at least 10 Mbit/s, while keeping the total cost manageable within the constraints of power, weight, and floor area. Balancing these factors, such as ensuring optimal data transmission speed, while staying within the 100 kg weight limit, 60W power consumption, and 12 square meters of space, is critical to the success of the installation.

We need to install a radio antenna at an inaccessible site that has limitations on power consumption, weight capacity, and floor layout, while also maximizing variety in capacity and speed. The site can support a total weight of 100 kg, a power consumption limit of 60W, and has 12 square meters of floor space available for the installation. The goal is to accommodate 1000 gamers, each requiring 1 Mbit of download speed with the lowest possible idle rates for both download and upload.
There are three types of antennas to consider for this setup: parabolic (PAR), monopole (MON), and dipole (DIP). Each of these antennas comes with different specifications in terms of weight, power consumption, floor area usage, and performance:
The PAR antenna weighs 2 kg, consumes 3W, occupies 1 square meter of floor space, costs 30k$, and offers 8 channels. Its download speed is 2 Mbit/s, and upload speed is 1 Mbit/s. The idle ping is 7 ms, increasing to 14 ms during downloads and 21 ms during uploads.

To meet the requirement of supporting 1000 gamers with 1 Mbit/s each, the combined antennas must provide at least 1000 Mbit/s of total download speed. The challenge is to configure the antenna setup within the constraints of the 100 kg weight limit, 60W power consumption, and 12 square meters of space, while minimizing idle times and keeping the price as low as possible.

Text:
We need to establish a radio antenna connection at an inaccessible site with strict limitations on power consumption, weight capacity, and floor layout. At the same time, we aim to provide as much variety in capacity and speed as possible to accommodate different types of users. The site can handle up to 100 kg in weight, a total power consumption of 60W, and a floor plan of 12 square meters.
There are three antenna options: parabolic (PAR), monopole (MON), and dipole (DIP). Each of these antennas varies in terms of weight, power consumption, and space requirements, as well as performance:
The PAR antenna weighs 2 kg, consumes 3W, takes up 1 square meter, and costs 30k$. It offers 8 channels, with a download speed of 2 Mbit/s and an upload speed of 1 Mbit/s. Its idle ping is 7 ms, increasing to 14 ms during downloads and 21 ms during uploads.
The MON antenna weighs 3 kg, consumes 9W, uses 2 square meters, and costs 40k$. It provides 256 channels, offering 4 Mbit/s download speed and 2 Mbit/s upload speed. The idle ping is 10 ms, while the ping during downloads is 45 ms and 125 ms during uploads.
The DIP antenna weighs 4 kg, consumes 27W, occupies 1 square meter, and costs 50k$. It features 64 channels, with a download speed of 16 Mbit/s and an upload speed of 3 Mbit/s. Its idle ping is 10 ms, with 82 ms during downloads and 324 ms during uploads.
The challenge is to create a setup that fits within the site's constraints while providing adequate speed and channel variety. Not only do we need to ensure that 100 Youtubers—each requiring 10 Mbit/s upload speed—can connect reliably, but we also need to meet these requirements in a way that minimizes costs. This involves carefully balancing the combined antenna weight, power consumption, and space utilization while providing enough bandwidth to handle the necessary data rate for both uploads and downloads. Price remains a key factor as we configure the antennas.

There are two possible patterns: the first pattern is to allocate the upper and lower slots of the first LBOARD and then the upper and lower slots of the second LBOARD with SBOARDs; the second pattern is to allocate the upper slots of the first and second LBOARDs first and then the lower slots of LBOARDs with SBOARDs going from left to right.

We increase the steps for LBOARD1 by 1, and allocate the upper slot first, followed by the lower slot. This is known as a mirror N allocation because the shape is the inverse of N. Another allocation type is Z allocation, where the shape is Z. SBOARDs allocate the first two slots, followed by the lower two slots. The type of allocation does not depend on LBOARDs, but only on SBOARDs. You can allocate the first two boards as inverse N and Z, and you can also allocate the remaining boards as inverse N and Z, regardless of how you allocate the first two boards.

There are two kinds of pairing: optional and mandatory. If we have two boards, BOARD1 and BOARD2, we must provide BOARD2 to BOARD1. We say BOARD1 requires BOARD2. This does not imply that giving BOARD2 automatically equates to giving BOARD1. We consider the first relation mandatory, while the others are optional. Unless otherwise specified, all relationships are optional. Different types of requirements, ranging from 1 to 1 to 1 to m, can be indicated using the REQ1... REQm symbol.

We refer to a board as BOARD if it occupies a single slot. If it occupies two slots, we refer to it as an LBOARD. There are 3 types of connectors: CON1, CON2, and CON3. We use different connectors for different types of cables. Cables with two ends use CON1, cables with three ends use CON2, and cables with four ends use CON4. This implies that the quantities for CON1, CON2, and CON3 should be 2, 3, and 4, respectively. DIR, 3P, and X stand for Direct, 3-Point, and Cross cables, respectively. Only one type of sigle slot board, known as GPT, receives all of those connectors. Each subrack receives at least two GPTs in the second and penultimate positions. If only one, two, or three subracks are available, the GPT board connects to the motherboard (MB) using DIR, 3P, and X cables. The MB always connects to the first GPT board. The DIR cable connects the two GPT boards in each subrack.

Design an efficient traffic routing and scheduling system for a city to minimize overall travel time, reduce congestion, and ensure timely arrival of vehicles at their destinations.

Variables:
1. Vehicles
2. Routes
3. Time Slots
4. Intersections

Domains:
Each vehicle  must be assigned a route and a time slot.
Routes are predefined paths between intersections.
Time slots represent discrete time intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

Constraints:

1. Capacity Constraints:
  Each route has a maximum capacity of vehicles that can travel on it during any given time slot.

2. Travel Time Constraints:
  Each route has an associated travel time.
  The arrival time for any vehicle on some route must be within the acceptable range for its destination.

3. Intersection Constraints:
  Each intersection can handle a limited number of vehicles at any time slot to avoid congestion.

4. Scheduling Constraints:
  Vehicles must depart at their assigned time slots.
  No two vehicles can occupy the same position on a route at the same time.

5. Priority Constraints:
  Emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) must be given priority on routes and intersections.

6. Continuity Constraints:
  Once a vehicle starts on a route, it must continue without interruption until it reaches its destination.

Objective Function:
Satisfy the total travel time for all vehicles while adhering to all constraints.
The total travel time has to be smaller than required_max_travel_time.

The Internet Network Traffic Routing and Scheduling problem involves satisfying data transmission requirements for users, while coordinating the flow of data packets through a network of routers and links.
Each link (network connection) has a certain capacity, latency, and possibly other attributes such as costs or bandwidth limits.
There are 'n' data packets, each with a specified source and destination.
Each data packet must be assigned a route from its source to its destination and requires some amount of bandwidth that is dependent on
the packet size.
The route for each data packet should be chosen to minimize latency, bandwidth consumption, or other specified costs.
Data packets may have specific transmission and delivery time windows.
The schedule must ensure that data packets do not exceed the link capacities at any given time to avoid congestion.
Network capacity constraints: The amount of data on any network link must not exceed its capacity.
Time constraints: Data packets must be transmitted and delivered within their specified time windows.
Each link has a capacity (maximum data it can handle), latency (time it takes for data to travel), and cost (resource usage or monetary cost) and bandwidth
limit (the maximum bandwidth it can provide).
Each packet has a size, source, destination, and possibly priority levels.
Scheduling must prevent any link from becoming overloaded to ensure smooth data flow.
Ensure that critical data packets meet their required maximum latency and bandwidth needs.
A valid solution to the Internet Network Traffic Routing and Scheduling problem ensures that all data packets are delivered to their destinations on time, complying with all constraints and optimizing for specified objectives.

The Individual Car Production Planning problem involves satisfying production requirements for different car models, while coordinating the selection and assembly of mechanical parts.


There are m different car models, each with specific requirements for mechanical parts.
Each car model has a bill of materials (BOM) that lists all the required mechanical parts and their quantities.
Mechanical parts have various attributes including cost, weight, compatibility, and availability.

The goal is to plan the production of each car model to meet demand while minimizing costs, production time, or other specified metrics.
Ensure that each car model meets quality and performance standards.

Mechanical parts must be selected from a pool of available parts, considering cost, compatibility, and availability.
Parts must be allocated to each car model according to its BOM.

Production facilities have limited capacity in terms of the number of cars that can be produced and the number of parts that can be handled simultaneously.
Production schedules must ensure that each car model is produced within its specified time frame.
Parts inventory must be managed to avoid shortages or overstock.

All selected parts must comply with quality and safety regulations.
Each car model must pass all required safety and performance tests.

Satisfy the total cost of production, which includes the cost of parts, labor, and other production resources.
Consider bulk purchasing discounts and supplier contracts.

Adapt the production plan in response to changes in demand, parts availability, or production capacity.

A valid solution to the Individual Car Model Production Planning problem ensures that all car models are produced on time, within budget, and meet all quality and performance standards, while satisfying the use of available resources and complying with all constraints.

There are 50 states,
For each state there is an electoral college coefficient which is a percentage.
Some states are swing states and those that are, have their indexes in the wsing states
array.
The electoral votes from the no swing states are just added to the Democratic party for
the non swing states where the electoral coefficient is greater than 0.5.
There it is considered the percentage of votes won by Democrats.
At the swing states, calculating the probability of Democrats winning has to be calculated.
It is calculated in the following way: An outcome is a random vector with elements as the
individual swing states, each swing state has a probability distribution equal to the
electoral coefficient at that state. For a single outcome, if the swing state votes were won
by the Democrats, its electoral votes are added to teh won votes, and if the added votes for
a single outcome are greater than the required votes for the win, the probability of that
particular outcome gets added to the total probability of the Democrats winning.
The goal is to have a probability higher than 0.5 for the given inputs, for the Democratic
party.

There are n cities in some area,
their distance is described by a nxn matrix in which there are distances between each
of the two cities (distance to the same city is zero and not considered, on the diagonal).
Cities do not have to be connected, and when they are not, there is a zero in the matrix for their distance.
There is also a nxn matrix that describes the terrain obstacles between them that range from 1 to 5.
1 would represent a meadow or a flat plane on which it is easy to build power and network gridlines.
The possible bandiwidth between two cities decreases by 10 for each unit of distance between them, the highest bandwidth at distance 1 being
100 Mb per second, the bandwidth does not decrease anymore when it reaches 30 Mb/s.
There is a banwidth converter that is a decimal number and ranges from 1 to 2, and it is given as an input parameter.
The bandwidth between two cities is calculated by calculating the bandwidth depending on the distance, then dividing by terrain factor,
and multiplying by the bandwidth converter.
The goal is to connect all cities so that the given total_bandwidth is achieved.
There is also a variable called bandwidth loss which is gotten by adding up for each of the connected cities, the product of the distance,
and the terrain factor, and it cannot surpass a given max_bandwidth_loss.

Problem Description: Airline Crew Rostering in Regional Airlines
Variables:
Crew members (pilots, co-pilots, flight attendants)
(for pilots there are experience level (integer (1, 2 or 3))arrays, and qualification levels)
(home base and salary arrays for all crew members(index))
Flights (routes, departure times, arrival times)
Time period: 14 days
Airports (home base and overnight locations) (assume every base in the problem has an airport)
The map is modeled with a 2d array of ariports intersections where diagonal zeros, and the airports that are not connected also,
and the rest have distances between two airports.
Aircraft types
(all types have their pilot qualification requirement (in a special array), and all types have their maximum distance
that it can be travelled with that type, there has to be a constraint that checks if a flights distance is
larger than the plane types allowed distance)
Constraints:


Qualifications:

Pilots must be qualified for specific aircraft types


Minimum experience levels for certain routes or aircraft
(if a route is longer than some distance, that requires a larger pilot experience level)


Crew pairing:
Each flight must have the required number of crew members (e.g., 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants)


Fairness:
Balanced allocation of weekend work and holidays
(no crew member can work more than 5 days in a row)


Legal requirements:
Compliance with local labor laws and union agreements
(no worker must work more than 20 hours a day)


Aircraft-specific constraints:
Certain routes may require specific aircraft types

Goals:
Primary goal: Create a feasible schedule that satisfies all constraints
aims to minimize the changes in qualification levels between consecutive flights
for a crew member. This is to reduce the complexity and potentially the cost
associated with training and transitioning between different types of aircraft.
Minimize total crew costs (salaries, hotel stays (hotel stays are all days that crew members spend away
from their home base, suppose each hotel day costs 100 dollars))
Maximize crew utilization (minimize idle time)
Minimize the number of crew position changes (to reduce training costs and improve familiarity)

Design a network traffic routing and scheduling system to handle 3 data packets across 2 links in 5 time slots. Each packet has a specified size, source, destination, priority, arrival time, and deadline. The packets' sizes are [100, 200, 150] bits, with sources [1, 1, 1] and destinations [2, 3, 2]. Priorities are [1, 2, 1], arrival times are [1, 2, 1], and deadlines are [4, 5, 3]. Link capacities are [250, 300] bits per time slot, latencies are [1, 2] time slots, costs are [5, 10], and bandwidth limits are [200, 250] bits per time slot. The system must minimize total latency, bandwidth consumption, and cost, ensuring constraints such as link capacity and bandwidth limits are not exceeded, and critical packets meet latency needs. The maximum allowed values are 3 for total latency, 450 for bandwidth, and 15 for cost.
