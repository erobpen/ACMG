Me: Can I ask you about codes written in MiniZinc as an example? Can you show only the source code? Bot: Yes. Tell me what kind of language optimization problems MiniZinc would like me to generate for you. Me: A source code in minizinc that resolve: A source code with 10 discrete variables with domain and with constraints. Put the Bot comments with % symbol.Bot:",
